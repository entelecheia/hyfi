project_description: Hyperfast Python Template is a self-contained template that helps
    you initialize your Python project inside the template. It is hyperfast in the
    sense that the template itself is converted into a Python project in the blink
    of an eye. It is also hyperfast in the sense that it helps you jump start your
    project with the best practices in the Python community.
